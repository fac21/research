# CSS and HTML Debugging

## How can we see and edit what elements and styles are rendered to the page?

---

Being a developer is not only coding bus also fixing and finding bugs. As a web developer, your best friend is the inspector of your chosen browser. 

**Most used browser:**
- [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/dom)
- [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector)

---

When you inspect a webpage, the DOM Tree of the Elements panel is where you do all DOM-related activities in DevTools.

When you're interested in a particular DOM node, Inspect is a fast way to open DevTools and investigate that node.

## How can we easily test how responsive our page is?

### Responsive web design helps you to avoid:
* wrong resizing
* inconvenient scrolling
* inappropriate zooming

### Simulate Mobile Devices with Device Mode in Chrome DevTools

Device Mode is the name for the features in Chrome DevTools that help you simulate mobile devices. 

You simulate the mobile user experience from your laptop or desktop.

* Right-click on the landing page of the website to open the menu, click "Inspect" 
* Shortcuts: Windows: **Ctrl + Shift + C** / Mac: **Cmd + Shift + C**

### Simulate a mobile viewport
Click Toggle Device Toolbar to open the UI that enables you to simulate a mobile viewport.

## How can we debug CSS grid and flexbox layouts?

---

### Debugging Grid 

---

### What makes an HTML element a grid?

If an HTML element on your page has ``` display: grid``` or ```display: inline-grid``` applied to it, it’s a grid.

You can quickly discover if a page has grid elements in the following ways...

---

### Discovery by inspection

---

In the above example, the div with the “wrapper” class is a grid.

---

You can see the grid is highlighted to show that it is now active 

---

### Discovery by overview

---
In a more complex web page, there may be many grids, and they may not be a child of the body. It is more work to find them by inspection if you want to understand the layout of a page.

---

---

Notice the image in the previous page had eight grids. You can see them listed under the subheading “Grid overlays” (see red box). The grids are listed in order of occurrence. 


---

### Debugging using Chrome DevTools

***Disclaimer: You can also use Firefox Dev Tools for debugging grid.***

---

You can make grids easier to identify by adding an ID or class to the element, or by using area names.

In the Instagram example, there were three ul elements that are grids but no IDs or classes (see red box). So, we can’t distinguish between them.

---

Adding classes to the ```ul``` makes them more identifiable!

---

The key takeaway is that you can often prevent running into problems later by appropriately naming uls with IDS and classes in order to distinguish them later  upon inspection.

### Debugging Flexbox
##### Flexbox Inspector created by Firefox DevTools
- discovering flex containers on a page
- examining and modifying flex containers
- debugging layout issues, etc.
