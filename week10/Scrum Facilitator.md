###### We all know that team collaboration is a necessity in the work or learning place. 
###### "A pair of working horses can pull a higher gross weight each than one alone could." 
###### That’s the power of collaboration. 
###### The right team collaboration strategies are important for every project’s success. Working in a collaborative environment simply means getting more work done faster.

It is good to make sure each team member understands their job within the team and has a role that fits their skills.
When individual roles are communicated, that boosts team collaboration and improve overall efficiency.

While it’s best to complete each project as a team, this may not be the most effective way to do every task. In some cases, group brainstorming is a waste of time. Instead, it might be better individuals to create ideas on their own and then everyone to present their suggestions after the separate brainstorming time.

When people feel free to communicate and express their ideas, they are more productive.
When team members know each other better, they are able to communicate and work together better.

To boost team collaboration, we can start playing some games or team-building activities. 
Games help to break the ice, build new relationships, and develop strong bonds among team members.

For our team to be effective, we need to have a great communication. Regular team meetings help everyone discuss their goals and get caught up on one another’s progress. It also prevents team members from performing the same tasks and helps everyone to stay on the same page.

For a team to be effective, everyone must be willing to compromise. In a group of people with varying egos, strengths, and abilities, everyone needs to know how to manage conflicts if they want to accomplish team goals.

---

If you need to create a lot of GitHub labels you could just create a fake issue, add all the labels in the labels field, upload it, and then save yourself some time.

---

### Estimates

The main purpose of doing estimates is to communicate to the product owner how long things are going to take (so they can in turn communicate to investors/users/marketing team etc. when its likely to get new features), and also to manage their expectations - so it is often good to overestimate a little to give yourselves breathing room.

### PERT Technique

Program Evaluation and Review Technique

---

P - most pessimistic case
O - most optimistic case
M - most like case

Calculation: (O + 4M + P)/6

Assign each of these the number of hours you think is a good assumption.

---

For example, setting up a log in and profile page feature.

P - 8 hours
O - 2 hours
M - 4 hours

---

Calculation: 

#### (O + 4M + P)/6

##### (2 + 14 + 8)6 = 4 hours

---

We can use this technique either to evaluate every issue, or just to evalutate specific tricky issues or things we think could be a bigger job.

---

### PERT Charts


PERT is centered around important dates, known as milestones. The most important milestone is the final due date, and we work backwards from there, using our PERT calculations. To get from one milestone to the next, we complete tasks. 

---


We identify tasks that have to occur in sequence, one after another, and those that can be done at the same time, known as parallel or concurrent tasks.

PERT takes a lot of time though! Another approach is planning poker, which is less mathematical, but can still take a bit of time. 

Planning poker = each member of the team votes an estimation for how long an issue takes and you average it out.
